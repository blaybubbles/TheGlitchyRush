**The Glitchy Rush** is an **endless runner** made in **Unity (C#)** for **Game Off 2021**.

The jam lasted about **4 weeks**, but I could dedicate only **~1 week** to development — focusing on rapid prototyping, fast iteration, and shipping a playable build.
Submitted **3 hours 20 minutes before the deadline**.
